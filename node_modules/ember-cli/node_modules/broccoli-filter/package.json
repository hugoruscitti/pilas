  "readme": "# broccoli-filter\n\nHelper base class for Broccoli plugins that map input files into output files\none-to-one.\n\nDocumentation to follow.\n\n**Can this help with compilers that are almost 1:1, like a minifier that takes\na `.js` and `.js.map` file and outputs a `.js` and `.js.map` file?**\n\nNot at the moment. I don't know yet how to implement this and still have the\nAPI look beautiful. We also have to make sure that caching works correctly, as\nwe have to invalidate if either the `.js` or the `.js.map` file changes. My\nplan is to write a source-map-aware uglifier plugin to understand this use\ncase better, and then extract common code back into this `Filter` base class.\n",
